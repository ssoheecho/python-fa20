## Creative Coding: Python Fall 2020

This is the class github repository for Python Fall 2020 course with Sven Travis.

For each week, there will be a corresponding folder with the in-class notebooks and exercise notebooks. 

Please clone this repository and ```git pull``` before class on Wednesday. We suggest that you make a copy of the cloned folder and make changes to the code there. If you're not one of the RAs or Sven, please refrain from making any pushes to the repository. If you are running into any issues, please reach out to Sohee.
